# Traffic-flow-prediction
This work considers combine multi-tricks with highway network to achieve traffic flow prediction accurately.  

## MODEL ITEM
### 1. MT-STNet: A Novel Multi-Task Spatiotemporal Network for Highway Traffic Flow Prediction (MT-STNet) [[codes link]](https://github.com/zouguojian/Traffic-flow-prediction/tree/main/MT-STNet)  
* Note that, for the MT-STNet program, it should be reproduced on the TensorFlow version >= 1.13.1. 
If not, there are some problems will appear in the running stage.
