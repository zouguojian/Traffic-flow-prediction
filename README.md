# Traffic-flow-prediction
This work considers combining multi-tricks with highway networks to achieve accurate traffic flow prediction.  

## MODEL ITEM
### 1. MT-STNet: A Novel Multi-Task Spatiotemporal Network for Highway Traffic Flow Prediction (MT-STNet) [[codes link]](https://github.com/zouguojian/Traffic-flow-prediction/tree/main/MT-STNet)  
* Note that the MT-STNet program should be reproduced on the TensorFlow version >= 1.13.1. 
If not, some problems will appear in the running stage.

#### NOTICE   
--->>>>>>> MT-STNet has been accepted by IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems TITS.   

The above codes have been uploaded to the Git-Hub page [[codes link]](https://github.com/zouguojian/Traffic-flow-prediction).
